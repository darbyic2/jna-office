Abandoned Project to Provide MS Office JNA Wrappers

This project was abandoned a long time ago. Please feel free to use/leverage any part of this code that you wish (private/commercial or otherwise).

Reasons for abandonment are many and complex. However, before you decide to resurrect the project please check the latest progress in the JNA project itself. When this project was abandoned Tobias Wolf had started work on tools to automatically generate wrappers for any registered COM library (including office).
